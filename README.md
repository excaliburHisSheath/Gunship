Gunship Engine/Editor
=====================

Gunship is an experimental game engine/editor being developed for learning experience. It attempts to make use of several techniques to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-extend, performant game engine.

Currently development is in the early planning phase, but if you're interested take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/excaliburHisSheath/OpenGDK/wiki), that's where we're collecting our ideas.
